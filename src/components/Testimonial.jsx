                We completed our house in late 2021, We built a larger house /
                our family home. In which Rafael was the main painter who almost
                single handily painted full interior and partial exterior, as
                our main exterior was majority brick cladding . So linear and
                soffits. Rafael is apart from a working machine, honest,
                reliable, and very hard working, and Punctual. His skills and
                finishing work are excellent which is what you would hope for
                when building or renovating. If we build or renovate again,
                Rafael will be our painter. Apart from his professionalism ,
                Rafael was always a pleasure personally on site. It can be very
                tough at times though the building process , so choosing the
                right tradespeople are very important. We were very lucky to
                have Rafael on our family home.

                Rafael's company and his team had great communication, were very
                prompt and completed tasks on time. They went above and beyond
                to deliver a quality job. I highly recommend Rafael's company. I
                have used his services three times and have been happy each
                time.

                Rafael and his crew were hired for a painting of the inside of
                my house, including the entryway and hall, living room, another
                hall, and the kitchen. They did a BEAUTIFUL job in time promised
                , and I am thrilled with the finished product. Rafael was also
                quite instrumental in helping me to pick out the right color. I
                was thinking of a particular color, and his recommendation
                turned out to be exactly the right match as the original color.
                I am so glad I finally listened to his advice, trusted his
                knowledge and expertise. I would highly recommend Rafael and his
                crew to anyone looking for a painting contractor. Thank you
                again. For surely I will use his services again in the future.
